# unsupervised-machine-learning-challenge

This project explores efforts to find better ways to predict myopia, or nearsightedness. The goal is to unsupervised learning to see if there are distinct groups of patients that can be analyzed separately or in clusters since the whoe data set failed to produce any usable data. 

I found that clustering would work to get usable data, using 4 clusters.
